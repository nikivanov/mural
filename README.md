## Positioning of the Drawing on the Wall

Here's how the image is prepared and drawn:

- The user defines the pin distance as part of the setup in the UI. For example 1 meter (or 1000mm). (This is d_pins in the image below.)
- The top margin is 20% of that distance, so the top of the image will be 200mm below the line between the two pins.
- Each side also has a 20% margin, so you'll get total of 60% of the horizontal distance, or 600mm.
- Now that we have the max width (600mm). The SVG is resized so its width is 600 and the height gets resized proportionally.
- Then a processing step is performed on the SVG to figure out what to actually draw, with each SVG unit being treated as millimeter.
- Finally it's converted into a simple format for Mural to draw, containing mostly its coordinate movement commands and pen up/down. This file is then uploaded to the microcontroller and executed line by line.
